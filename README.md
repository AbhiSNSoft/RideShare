The motivation for building this app is the current traffic condition of Bengaluru.

Most of the People travel alone in their vehicle, even though people want to travel together they wouldnt know who stays near their route.

There are already ride sharing platforms but most of them are open for public, if its private we need to pay money making it private.
And for every we need to pay money, which doesnt make any sense.

Being nth car pool app, it should solve the fundamental problem of connecting people together and it should be free for the employees to use.
Thats exactly what it does, just suggests people going near your destination.

This app is built on Firebase and follows serverless architechture.
The running costs are almost nil. Which is major difference between this and other apps.

The app is running in my company past 4 months wihtout spending a penny on hosting and other services.
